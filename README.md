## Introduction
- For Workshop 3, I decided to create a collage that captures the ongoing time through the changing colors of the sky. Using four photographs I took with my phone, I aimed to document how the day unfolds and transitions, from morning to evening (night). I want to experience and highlight the dynamic shifts in light and colour that mark the progression of the day.
- Exploring, I delved deeper to explore the resources provided on https://p5js.org/reference/p5/image/, which offers detailed guidance on calculating image size, as well as determining width and height. Using these insights, I plan to include techniques from the examples to enhance the visual and technical aspects for my collage coding. 
- I decided to look into workshop 3 video, image() resources and start the code. https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/121821/pages/week-2-overview?module_item_id=2435968.

**coding progress**
- When I first started, everything seemed to be progressing smoothly as I built the project step by step. However, I encountered an issue where the images didnâ€™t display in the sketch. Unsure of how to resolve it, I reached out to a friend and leo for assistance. They helped me identify and address the error, which turned out to be related to
```ruby
function setup(){
createCanvas(400,400);
 imgs.push(night);
 imgs.push(evening);
 imgs.push(morning);
}
```
and
```ruby
function draw(){
  background(220);
  image(imgs[2], 0, 0);
}
```
Once this issue was resolved, I was able to proceed with the project successfully and with confidence. The images I selected were highly appropriate for the workshop, as they effectively conveyed my intention to highlight the nature of a single day.

- After completing a simple collage, I thought putting filter would be fun, so decided to add 'BLUR' effect, and it turned out quite significant and interesting.

- I thought with the blurred collage, I was determined to write a text in the middle with the font 'Courier New', making it aesthetic, simple and with a meaning too. 


**Adding text**
```rubyi
 fill(255); // white text
  text("i have finished my day... goodbye", width / 2, height / 2); // centered text
```
**Font size**
```ruby
textSize(32); // setting font size
  textAlign(CENTER, CENTER); // center text
  textFont("Courier New"); // courier new text font
}
```

**RESULT**

## Conclusion(+ further improvement)
- By studying workshop 3, and getting help from friends on this page, I gained a deeper understanding of how to manipulate images programmatically. It was quite confusing and were some errors happening on visual studio code, but I will have to improve on adding weight/2 and height/2 on images and also double-check if something is missing inside the sketch.
- For further improvement, I recognized that I need to refine my ideas. Today's sketch, upon reflection, lacked the abstract and engaging qualities present in my earlier workshop pieces. It resembled something one might find in a Pinterest collage, which I didn't particularly admire. However, I viewed it as more of a practice exercise- a skill- building attempt to make a photo into a sketch. In that sense, I found the process enjoyable and somewhat rewarding.
