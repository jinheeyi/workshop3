## Introduction
- For Workshop 3, I decided to create a collage that captures the ongoing time through the changing colors of the sky. Using four photographs I took with my phone, I aimed to document how the day unfolds and transitions, from morning to evening (night). I want to experience and highlight the dynamic shifts in light and colour that mark the progression of the day.
- Exploring, I delved deeper to explore the resources provided on https://p5js.org/reference/p5/image/, which offers detailed guidance on calculating image size, as well as determining width and height. Using these insights, I plan to include techniques from the examples to enhance the visual and technical aspects for my collage coding.
- I decided to look into workshop 3 video, and make the coding. https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/121821/pages/week-2-overview?module_item_id=2435968.

**coding progress**
- When I first started, everything seemed to be progressing smoothly as I built the project step by step. However, I encountered an issue where the images didnâ€™t display in the sketch. Unsure of how to resolve it, I reached out to a friend for assistance. She helped me identify and address the error, which turned out to be related to
```ruby
function setup(){
createCanvas(400,400);
 imgs.push(night);
 imgs.push(evening);
 imgs.push(morning);
}
```
and
```ruby
function draw(){
  background(220);
  image(imgs[2], 0, 0);
}
```
After resolving this problem, it allowed me to move forward with the project successfully.

- I think I was quite happy on how I choose the photos, which was a timeslapse from morning to night time.

## Conclusion(+ further improvement)
- By studying workshop 3, and getting help from friends on this page, I gained a deeper understanding of how to manipulate images programmatically. It was quite confusing and were some errors happening on visual studio code, but I will have to improve on adding weight/2 and height/2 on images and also double-check if something is missing inside the sketch.
